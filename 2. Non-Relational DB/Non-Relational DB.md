    NoSQL systems allow you to drag-and-drop your data into a folder and then query it
    without creating an entity-relational model.
  - **<ins>Multi threads processing:</ins>**  
    NoSQL systems allow you to store your database on multiple processors and maintain
    high-speed performance.
  - **<ins>Shared-nothing commodity computers:</ins>**  
    Most (but not all) NoSQL systems leverage low-cost commodity processors that have
    separate RAM and disk.
  - **<ins>It supports linear scalability (horizontal scaling):</ins>**  
    When you add more processors, you get a consistent increase in performance.
